// This is a temporary js file until we move our code over to Svelte
// Just adding a simple log command to make sure it works.
// Trust svelte is wayyyy better. But the only issue is that we might not have time to learn it

let counter = 0;
function printHelloWorld() {
    console.log("Hello World " + counter);
    counter++;
}
